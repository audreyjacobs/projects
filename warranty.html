        <h2 class="h2"> New Potato Warranty Policy  </h2>

        <p> 
            <br> <br> 
            New Potato values our customers and our reputation as a premium manufacturer of consumer electronic goods.
            We stand behind the products that we design, engineer and manufacturer and offer a simple limited one-year warranty on every New Potato electronic product we sell. <br> <br> 

            We believe the original purchaser of any New Potato product, who bought their product from an authorized retailer, is entitled to a product that under normal conditions 
            of use is reliable, robust, and free of problems due to material defects or workmanship. <br> <br> 

            Our warranty begins on the original date of purchase and ends one year from that date. Our warranty policies do not cover damage due to misuse, abuse, unauthorized 
            modifications, or damage due to exposure to the elements or external causes such as acts of nature. <br> <br> 

            Our warranty terms may be adjusted or further defined for each product we sell. Please check the warranty details for your particular product as may be provided 
            on this web site. There are no other warranties or agreements, expressed or implied. Our limited warranty is the sole and exclusive remedy, offered in lieu of 
            all other warranties, expressed or implied. New Potato is not responsible for any indirect, incidental, or punitive damages arising from use of its product(s). <br> <br> 

            On-line Purchase Refund Policy <br> <br> 
            If you purchased a product directly from New Potato Technologies via our online store and are not completely satisfied, you may return your purchased item to New 
            Potato for a refund within 30 days of of your purchase. <br> <br> 

            All products must be returned to us along with their original packaging, including all accessories, components, manuals, and/or documentation that was shipped to 
            you with your purchased product. You must obtain an RMA number prior to returning your purchase to New Potato; items returned without a valid RMA number on the 
            outside of the parcel will not be accepted. <br> <br> 

            If you purchased your New Potato product elsewhere, any refund will be subject to the policies of the authorized retailer where you made your purchase.
