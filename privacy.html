        <p> 
            <br> <br> 
            New Potato is a cyber conscious corporation and has developed these good information practices to assure that your privacy is respected 
            and your personal data is protected. Our Privacy Policy discloses New Potato's online information practices for handling personal and 
            non-personal information, which is meant to comply with applicable local laws and regulations. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully 
            before you use any of New Potato's web sites ("Site(s)"). <br> <br> 

            How Your Information Is Used: <br> <br> 
            New Potato will not sell, rent, loan or lease your personally identifiable information to others unless we have your permission or are 
            required by law to do so. New Potato will not use or share the personally identifiable information that you provide to us online in ways 
            unrelated to those described herein without first letting you know and offering you a choice to opt out. <br> <br> 

            We may need to share your personal information with our business units or affiliates. We will only share your information with other New 
            Potato entities (including subsidiaries and affiliates) and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf to provide the necessary 
            service or information requested by you, to consolidate data storage, or to simplify the management of customer information. Such New 
            Potato entities and/or business partners are governed by our Privacy Policy with respect to the use of this data and are bound by 
            appropriate confidentiality agreements. If you have any problems exercising your choice to opt out, please Contact Us. <br> <br>

            aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks 
            were "clicked" with Cookies. Such information is not linked to any personally identifiable information. The non-personally identifiable 
            information we collect help us identify the most popular areas of our Site and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. <br> <br>

            Cookies are text files that store some information on your computer's hard drive and allow our systems to recognize your browser. Cookies 
            collect information like IP addresses, operating systems and browser software, but they do not collect any personal information. Cookies 
            let you customize your experience at our Site. <br> <br> 

            We may also use cookies to record anonymous information pertaining to particular web pages viewed, which helps us in analysing trends, 
            tracking user's movement, and gathering broad demographic information for aggregate use. In this effort, we may also use measurement technologies 
            from our business partners to assist us in gathering and analysing that data. <br> <br>

            At some New Potato sites, you can order products, register for materials, make requests, download software, enter contests, vote in polls or

            communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, 
            telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and 
            services. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you register your ownership of New Potato products. 
            New Potato uses your information to better understand your needs and to provide you with better service.
